Aircraft Drawing with Computer Vision

Project Overview

This innovative project leverages computer vision and robotics to create a unique aircraft that can draw and write in four distinct colors: red, green, blue, and yellow. The aircraft operates autonomously, tracking hand movements and switching between colors to produce dynamic visual patterns on a virtual canvas.

Key Features

Color Tracking: The system employs MediaPipe, a powerful real-time hand tracking library, to differentiate between colors and enable precise drawing by the aircraft.
Interactive Canvas: A virtual canvas provides an interactive interface for users. Simply use hand gestures to switch between drawing colors or clear the canvas completely.
Real-time Processing: OpenCV, a comprehensive computer vision library, is utilized for real-time processing of video frames. This ensures immediate interaction and visual feedback for the user.
Technologies Employed

Python: The core programming language for development, providing a versatile and efficient foundation for the project.
OpenCV: This robust library offers a vast array of functions for video processing and drawing on the virtual canvas.
MediaPipe: MediaPipe stands out for its ability to perform real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition, enabling seamless user interaction.
NumPy: This library provides high-performance numerical operations and array manipulations, streamlining computations within the project.
How It Works

Hand Tracking: The webcam captures the user's hand movements, and MediaPipe takes over, identifying and tracking key hand landmarks (e.g., fingertips, palm).
Color Selection: Users can conveniently select drawing colors by simply hovering their hand over designated color areas displayed on the screen.
Drawing: The aircraft replicates the detected hand movements on the virtual canvas, drawing lines in the user-selected color in real-time.
